This calculates the uncorrected distance or p-distance, which takes the equation p = ni / n, where ni is the number of different sites and n is the total number of compared sites. Before the comparisson, the gap-containing sites are removed (ref: http://websites.umich.edu/~zhanglab/publications/2003/a0005108.pdf).
